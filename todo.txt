add magic calculation of cocktailamounts…

we need some way to calculate "Eigenbedarf"

check if festMenu is still able to change planned/price for cocktails…

maybe introduce a type shoppinglist?

we have to track the awaited guests somewhere…
	maybe add another field to database, and also track some other information
	also, ask for how many guests to be planned for, when querying this value…

change error-value for quitting, so you only quit when you quit

restructure code flow:
	move menu-code into own file
	move database-code (code dealing only with database) to own file
	move code for handling inventory, fest, cocktails to own file
